          My name is Christian Simpson and I am 19 years old and I love anything to do with computers thats why I am in the computer programming course. I am currently living in an appartment with 4 other of my friends. I usually in my spare time play video games of all kinds. i think of it like this, if a game is fun I will play it other than that I will try to practice coding as often as I can.
